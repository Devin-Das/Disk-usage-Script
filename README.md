# Disk Usage Script in Bash
This is my test script in bash which output mounted disk usage in percentage and sends alert to user's email if reached certain threshold. Clean output when executed. To be able to use the email alert to your email, you should an MTA installed on your Linux machine. Eg: Postfix.
